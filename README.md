Grand Luxury Tree - Christmas Edition 🎄
An immersive, interactive 3D Christmas experience powered by Three.js and MediaPipe. This project visualizes a luxury particle tree that transforms into a photo gallery, controlled entirely by hand gestures via your webcam.

✨ Features
3D Particle System: A dynamic tree composed of thousands of glowing particles, snow, and ornaments.
Gesture Control: Use hand gestures (via Webcam) to control the animation states (Tree, Scatter, Focus).
Photo Integration:
Upload local files or folders directly via the UI.
Automatically scans a local ./images/ directory.
Visual Effects: High-end post-processing including Unreal Bloom, cinematic lighting, and atmospheric fog.
Responsive Design: Adapts to window resizing automatically.
🚀 Getting Started
Installation & Running
Download the project: Save the file as Christmas_Tree.html in your project folder.

Open the File: Simply double-click Christmas_Tree.html to launch it in your default web browser. (Note: An active internet connection is required to load the 3D engine and AI models).

Grant Permissions: Allow camera access when prompted to enable gesture controls.

🖐️ Gesture Controls
This project uses MediaPipe Hand Landmarker to track your hand in real-time. Ensure your hand is visible in the webcam preview (bottom left).

Gesture	Action	Description
Fist ✊	Tree Mode	Particles assemble into the Christmas tree shape.
Open Hand ✋	Scatter Mode	Particles and photos explode outward and rotate with your hand.
Pinch 👌	Focus Mode	(Thumb & Index) Selects a random photo and brings it to the front.
Keyboard Shortcut: Press H to hide/show the UI and Webcam overlay.
Mouse: Left-click and drag to rotate the view (OrbitControls).
🖼️ Adding Photos
Method 1: UI Upload
Click the "Select Files" or "Select Folder" buttons in the top-right corner to load images immediately.

Method 2: Local Directory
Create a folder named images in the same directory as the HTML file. Rename your photos numerically (e.g., (1).jpg, (2).png). The system is configured to scan for:

./images/(1).jpg to ./images/(200).jpg
./images/(1).png to ./images/(200).png
⚙️ Configuration
You can customize the visual parameters by editing the CONFIG object inside the <script> tag in Christmas_Tree.html:

const CONFIG = {
    colors: {
        bg: 0x050d1a,         // Background color
        champagneGold: 0xffd966,
        // ...
    },
    particles: {
        count: 1500,          // Number of ornaments
        snowCount: 1000,      // Snow density
        treeHeight: 24,
        // ...
    },
    // ...
};
🛠️ Tech Stack
